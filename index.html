<h2>Dogs and Cats!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Try to click on the dogs while avoiding the cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope they don't get too bored with my game. 
The players would learn to have fast reflexes and eye coordination and come to love colors!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game fits into a kids genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
<li>1. Wait for the dogs to pop up.
<li>2. Avoid collision with the cats.
<li>3. Click on the dogs, they'll disappear.
<li>The character should be able to move left, right and jump.
The cats generate from the center of the screen while the dogs float up and down.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Cool music and very colorful.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
</li>This game is abstract. 
Made in a make believe place located in the middle of no where, 
with dogs and cats that just pop out of no where.
The dogcatcher is the only character that exists besides the animals.
So far, the character can't move, the cats spew out of no where, and the dogs float.
The cats and dogs are giants, while the character is minuscule in comparison.
There is no backstory and there are no tokens.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted for children 5 years old and under.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game is finished in like 20 - 30 seconds.
The dogs are already generated at a certain amount each time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player should first identify where the dogs are located.
Then when there's a large gap where there are no cats, quickly click on the dog.
Also, try to avoid your avatar from colliding with the cats.
You'll die, or at least I want it to happen, that's still a work in progress.
</li>
